-Create a class to control tasks within the process,
Objective: orderly shutdown, without tasks accessing deleted objects.

-Create a class that opens and initializes all hardware ports on the cRio.
  Design Requirements:
    Can create dummy objects
    Can create simulated objects
    Checks resources for conflicts prior to opening.
    
-Interrupt based camera-linescanner task.

-Kill signal simulator (to simulate shutdowns that occur when reloading code.)
Reason:  When code is reloaded, old code is killed.  If tasks are left runnning, or resources
still held, then the cRio may hang or operate unpredictably.

-Servo Setup
 Design Requirement: Standalone utility to setup servo positions

-Jaguar base operation 
 Design Requirement:
   Standalong utility to operate Jaguars or groups of Jaguars
   Work for Serial or Ethernet based CAN
   
   
-Drivetrain: Reorg
Design Requirements:
  Drivetrain should include instances of ESC's (not be class extensions) to better allow ganging.
  
 
-CAN thread
  Currently:
    *) main loop releases Jag threads (Problem if jags deleted)
    *) jag threads set and read values.  Set command is ambiguous depending on mode. 
     Interface should include the mode, and change mode as required.
    *) Jag Reader function: Requests and Reads currents & pot values from each jaguar.
