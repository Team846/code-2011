======================

Tasks after shipping
/ Autonomous routine
	/ Release ringer
/ Current sensing + 2CAN
/ Synchronized for Update calls
/ Pot values 0 to 1023
/ Lift/arm pot configuration
/ Difference in speed when spitting
- Back off after squaring ringer up with lift?
- TODOs
- Roller automation
- Periodic movement of roller inward
- Line sensing
- set buttons on ds for auton modes

What to test
/ Address Mr. G's concerns
	/ Software deployment - LRT_ROBOT_2011 and enabling one component at a time
/ Set roller gains to the default values in code
/ Get apply/load config working
/ Test difference in speed when spitting
- Look at current values
	- Detect a ringer?
- Roller automation
	- Set correct button mappings
	/ Test automated routine
- Switching to CANJaguar (figure out how to do virtual mode)
- Line sensing
	- Config values
	- Remove get line position
- Autonomous detect wall
- Assign buttons

Task list at 612
- Service mode
- Autonomous stall detection
- Autonomous with hardware
- Bring carpet + tape replica
- Add servo values for 2010
- LED issue
- Lift DS soft switch for autonomous
- End line detection
- Split detection + choosing a side
- Fix extra cycle count printing (increased period)

Simulation
- Confirm button mappings of roller
- Change lift preset based on high/low row
- Lift aborted flag
- Abort button
- Disable control = what value to set? (setpoint array)
- Set lift pot config value to 0.2
- Deadband issue
- Reset more action data values in disabled mode?
- Autonomous mode (without line sensing)
- ID integrity
- Turn off all speed controllers values getting sent
- Minibot deployment code

Tasks before shipping
/ Calibrating shifter, lift, and arm
/ Prepare control board for shipping
- Configure SmartDashboard
- Controls must be decided and mapped (how can I do something; use a key)

Shifting
/ When shift button is pressed, set shift timer to 2 seconds
/ If shift timer hasn't expired or power is applied to drive train, set servo to value
/ Else turn servo power off

Lift
/ Manual modes and protection against stalling (predicted time; shut off power)
/ Presets and joystick 
- Fault indicator on dashboard (light + description)
/ Address power loss [press apply config button; no need to disable]

Arm
/ Manual modes and protection against stalling (predicted time; shut off power)
/ Presets and up/down buttons
- Fault indicator on dashboard (light + description)

Tasks to assign
/ Control board
/ Make smaller encoder wire
