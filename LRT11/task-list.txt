Tasks before shipping
/ Calibrating shifter, lift, and arm
/ Prepare control board for shipping
- Configure SmartDashboard
- Controls must be decided and mapped (how can I do something; use a key)

Shifting
/ When shift button is pressed, set shift timer to 2 seconds
/ If shift timer hasn't expired or power is applied to drive train, set servo to value
/ Else turn servo power off

Lift
/ Manual modes and protection against stalling (predicted time; shut off power)
/ Presets and joystick 
- Fault indicator on dashboard (light + description)
/ Address power loss [press apply config button; no need to disable]

Arm
/ Manual modes and protection against stalling (predicted time; shut off power)
/ Presets and up/down buttons
- Fault indicator on dashboard (light + description)

Tasks to assign
/ Control board
/ Make smaller encoder wire
